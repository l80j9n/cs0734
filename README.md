1. Let   Q   ∈ R.    Find   the   generating   function   of   σα (n) =Σd|ndα .
2. Prove   that


for   s   >   max{cf ,   cg   }   with   cf      and   cg      the   abscissa   of   absolute   con-   vergence   of Σ f(n)n—s    and Σ∞n=1 g(n)/ns      respectively,   where   h   is given   by


the Dirichlet convolution of   f   and   g   (see   Problems   IV,   Question   2).
